## Description:

This is a full stack Python Flask app that emulates a simple social media website. This was my first ever full stacks project, and built in about 2 weeks.

## Features:

- Login/Reg with validations & bcrypt for hashing passwords
- Users can make only 1 post per day, which includes image upload via form.
- Users can change their avatar via form image upload.
- Users can follow any other person on the website (1-way)
- Users can search for users by first name or user name
- Users can comment on their friends posts. 
- Comments are only visible to the user who posted.
- Cron scheduler to auto delete all posts / comments / images at 12am every morning
